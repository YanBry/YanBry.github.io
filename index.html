             I"M PROUD OF YOUUU. Now for the main purpose of this letter. Sorry about earlier.
             Sorry if it looked like I was neglecting your point and because of it you were invalidated.
             Sorry dahil imbes na nakapag pahinga ka mas lalo kang nadismaya. I just wanted you to
             appreciate one of my interests and I apologize because somewhat I was forcing you to
             like it. I only did that because what I had in mind is that if math became your fav sub, 
             you wouldn't be stressed about it.
             Sorry talaga!
